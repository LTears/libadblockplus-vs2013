Like most Linux/Unix programs, ./configure && make should work to build the
system. You can also pass configure options to change which repository to
download from, or even use an existing mozilla-central checkout and build. The
source code for SpiderMonkey is required, since this uses internal APIs. If you
have your own repository, a revision newer than 2cf0bbe3772a is required, since
that revision changed the parse APIs. However, a newer revision could
potentially break the code.

The code is not known to work with all JS features; the only code that
probably does not work is E4X code. If you find a bug in the program, feel free
to contact me on irc.mozilla.org (nick: jcranmer) or email me at
<Pidgeot18@gmail.com>. Since this program uses bleeding-edge versions of
SpiderMonkey, some bugs may be due to broken code there.
